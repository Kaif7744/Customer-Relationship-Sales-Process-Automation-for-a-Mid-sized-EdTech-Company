# Salesforce Capstone Project: EdTech CRM & Sales Automation

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

### 1. Problem Statement
An EdTech company struggles with managing leads, tracking the sales pipeline, automating follow-ups, and integrating payments with course enrollments. The goal is to build a Salesforce-based solution that streamlines sales, student enrollments, and reporting.

### 2. Requirement Gathering
- Capture leads from multiple sources (website, social media, referrals).
- Track sales pipeline (Lead → Opportunity → Enrollment).
- Automate reminders for demo sessions and payments.
- Create approval process for discounts.
- Enable role-based dashboards (Sales, Students, Management).
- Integrate with external payment gateways (Stripe/Razorpay).
- Ensure secure data access (profiles, roles, FLS).

### 3. Stakeholder Analysis
- **Students** → Want smooth enrollment & payment process.
- **Sales Team** → Need lead tracking & automation.
- **Management** → Require dashboards for revenue & performance.
- **Support Team** → Need case tracking for student issues.

### 4. Business Process Mapping
1. Lead comes in from a source.  
2. Sales rep contacts lead and schedules demo.  
3. If lead is interested → convert to Opportunity → Enrollment → Payment.  
4. Auto-create student record on payment success.  
5. Management tracks pipeline & revenue via reports.  

### 5. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
- EdTech industry growing rapidly with online courses.
- High competition → customer experience & automation are key.
- Companies need CRM for **lead nurturing, enrollment management, and integrations** with learning platforms.

### 6. AppExchange Exploration
- **Salesforce Education Data Architecture (EDA)** – useful for student/course management.
